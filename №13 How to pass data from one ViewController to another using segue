How to pass data from one ViewController to another using segue?

// It turns out to be quite easy.

1. First, given we have starting point ViewController, we need to add another one from the object library.

2. After that, we have to create a new .swift file and attach to our newlyCreated ViewController.

We will be working with the simpliest example: "textField" for the 1st view controller and "Label" for the second one.

I assume, you ve done all heavy-lifting and connected our elements to corresponding swift files.

3. There is a special func that has to be overriden to transport the needed data:


override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)
    {
        
        if segue.identifier == "goToSecondScreen" {
            
            let destinationVC = segue.destination as! secondViewController
            
            destinationVC.textPassedOver = textField.text
            
        }
        
        Let's go over the "func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)":
        
            goToSecondScreen - identifier of the second ViewController;
            segue.destination - specifies destination ViewController;
            secondViewController - name of the second ViewController;
            textPassedOver - name of the var of type String? declared in the second ViewController;
            textField - name of the text field declared in the first ViewController;
            
            

That is the archietcture of the secondViewController: 

import UIKit

class secondViewController: UIViewController {
    
    var textPassedOver : String?
    
    @IBOutlet weak var label: UILabel!
    

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        label.text = textPassedOver
