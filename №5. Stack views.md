â„–5. Stack views.

Gone those days when iOS developers relied on Auto layout and alighnment consttrains.

Currently, the most wise and time-efficient way distributing ui elemnts equally horizontally/vertically is to put them 
inside stack views and apply a lot of distribution options to the whole stack view, not each particual UI element.

To enable stack view we have to multiple selest items and click on leftmost icon in the lower right corner of the xCode:

Stack views makes the elements perfectly distributed in any orientation.

Stack views on the file inspector:

There are horizontal and  vertical stack view with a bunch of options applied!
