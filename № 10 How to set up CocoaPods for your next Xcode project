How to set up CocoaPods for your next Xcode project

// I assume that Terminal is open and is ready for input (prompt sign $ is at the end of the line)

~ sudo gem install cocoapods

// So to trace what will be happening on the back stage of installation process

~ pod setup —verbose

// That’s it, CocoaPods are installed and setup on our system

// Put pods into Xcode project

// I assume that you are inside directory where 
your Xcode project rests

// So, to initialise CocoaPods

~ pod init

// «Podfile » has been added to your project folder

~ open -a Xcode Podfile

// After that, terminal will pop-up with document editor of «Podfile» for us to add several lines of code to it.


// Your «Podfile» should look exactly like mine except for pods you would like to harness!

<-- START

platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'Clima' do

  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks

  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Clima (name of Xcode project)

pod 'SwiftJSON'
pod 'Alamofire'
pod 'SVProgressHUD'

end

FINISH -->


// Back to Terminal

// Next, we have to figure out our current version of CocoaPods

~ pod --version

// Now, we are ready to install all CocoaPods
that were specified in our «Podfile»

~  pod install

// Well done!

One more advice. What if some of pods you install previously needs an update? Easy

~ pod update
