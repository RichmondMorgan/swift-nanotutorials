â„–8 Class inheritance in Swift. How to create a sub-class from the super-class.

class Car {
    var colour = "Black"
    let numberOfSeats : Int = 5
    
  
  
  // Below, we created a sub-class "SelfDrivingCar" from super-class "Car" and, inherited all the properties pertaining to it.
  // After creating a sub-class we don't need to refer to the parent class in any way. Just access the properties via "." 
  // notation.

class SelfDrivingCar : Car{

var gpsModuleGeneration = 3
    
}

// Inheritance works in such a way that if we create sub-class (grand child) from a sub-class (child), 

// not only we inherit properties from the nearest super-class, but as well we have an access to all properties down to 
the root parent class

// For example, "anotomousCarriage" inherits not only all properties of "SelfDrivingCar" class, but, as well, the ones from
"Car" class such as "colour" and "bumberOfSeats"

class anotomousCarriage : SelfDrivingCar {

}
