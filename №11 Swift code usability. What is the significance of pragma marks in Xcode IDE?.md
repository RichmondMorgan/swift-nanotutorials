№11 Swift code usability. What is the significance of pragma marks in Xcode IDE?

Though, not native to this particular IDE, pragma marks is a method categorization approach facilitating a quick detection
(time saver, indeed) where over-complex code makes it tremendously arduous to quickly navigate between different
groups of methods.

All pragma marks can be easily accessed from
Jump bar. So to speak, you can easily get to a particular chunk of your code by selecting it.

Grouping logic is pretty straightforward and is based on tagging groups responsible for a specific types of tasks.

For instance, you can easily group methods managing AlertView show up under different set of conditions.

Pragma marks don’t affect the code itself in a sense that it cannot spoil functionality and 
And performance. The only metric it sways, though, is code intelligibility.
