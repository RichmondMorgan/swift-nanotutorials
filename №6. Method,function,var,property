â„–6. Difference between methods and functions & var/let and properties.

// Simply put, method is a function declared as the imternal part of class.

// Function is not a part of a class but declared and can be accessed not only by the means of inheritance.

// To exemplify:

import Foundation

enum CarType {
    case Sedan
    case Coupe
    case Hatchback
}

class Car {

// Below we declared three vars (one of the is non-mutable), these are three properties cause they are parts of "Car" class.

    var colour = "Black"
    let numberOfSeats : Int = 5
    var typeOfCar : CarType = .Coupe
    
    init() {
    }
    
    convenience init (customerChosenColour : String) {
        self.init()
        colour = customerChosenColour
    }
    
  
  // Below we declared "drive" method inside "Car" class
  
   func drive(){
        print("Car is moving")
        
    }
    
}
